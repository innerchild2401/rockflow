# Chat layout (mobile and desktop)

- **Only the chat message list should be scrollable.** Headers, filters, and any bars above the list must not scroll; use `shrink-0` and keep the scroll container as a single `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` (or equivalent) wrapper around the messages.
- **Text input must stay sticky at the bottom.** Use `shrink-0` on the input/form container so it does not shrink and remains anchored at the bottom of the chat panel.
- **Container:** The chat panel (card or wrapper) must be `flex flex-col overflow-hidden` (and `min-h-0` / `flex-1` where it lives in a flex parent) so that only the inner scroll div scrolls, not the whole panel.
- Applies to **CompanyFeed** (social feed) and **TaskChat** (task chat), on both **mobile** and **desktop**.
