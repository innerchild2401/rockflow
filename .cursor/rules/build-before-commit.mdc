# Build before commit

Before committing and pushing changes that affect the app or dependencies:

1. **Run the full build locally:** `npm run build`
2. Only commit and push if the build completes successfully (exit code 0).
3. If the build fails, fix the errors and run `npm run build` again before committing.

This ensures the project builds on Vercel. The user runs `git push` after your commits.
