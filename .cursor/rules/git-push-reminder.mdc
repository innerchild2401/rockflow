# Git workflow

When making changes that should be in version control:

1. **Stage and commit:** Use `git add` and `git commit` with a clear message.
2. **Push:** Run `git push` with **full permissions** (`required_permissions: ["all"]`) so the command can use the user's system Git credentials (Credential Manager / SSH).
3. If push was not run or failed, tell the user: **To update the remote, run:** `git push`
